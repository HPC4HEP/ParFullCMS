ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
G4NDL data comes largely from the ENDF/B-VII library 
which is developed and maintained by 
the Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) (http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/csewg/).  
The original data files may be accessed at the National Nuclear Data Center webpage, 
http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/ 
G4NDL data also comes from the JENDL library which is developed and maintained by 
Nuclear Data Evaluation Center of Japan Atomic Energy Agency. 
(http://wwwndc.tokai-sc.jaea.go.jp/index.html) 
The original data files may be accessed at the Japanese Evaluated Nuclear Data Library web page.

v4.5 (2013.Aug)
Information of data source is added to each file
Rename old README to README.old
This file now becomes README

v4.4 (2013.Jul)
Update 74W182 and 90Th232, because their inelastic cross sections have inconsistency to the final state data.

v4.3 (2013.Jun)
Elastic, Inelastic, Capture, Fission and ThermalScattering data were zlibed.
Thermal-neutron data is distributed together with standard data again (G4NDL.4.3.tar.gz). 

v4.2 (2012.Nov)
The thermal data was separeted from the standard G4NDL tar ball (G4NDL.4.2.tar.gz) and it is disrtibuted as G4NDL.4.2.TS.tar.gz.
Problems were found in following isotopes and fixed 
44Ru105, 60Nd146, 63Eu152 and 92U238

v4.1 (2012.Jun)
Most data is converted from ENDF/B-VII.r1 with processing by NJOY-99.u364 with reconstruction tolerance of 0.001.
(We are still using NJOY99, and once NJOY2010 becomes available, 
we will re-precessing by the tool which support a lot of new features like RML.)

Following isotopese are exception
Cl35 data cannot be finished njoy processing (put same data of G4NDL4.0)
MT600 block exists without MT103 block 
4Be7, 25Mn55, 33As74, 39Y90, 40Zr90, 40Zr91, 40Zr92, 40Zr93, 40Zr94, 40Zr95, 40Zr96
69Tm168, 69Tm169, 69Tm170, 74W180, 74W182, 74W183, 74W184, 74W186
90Th232, 91Pa231 and 91Pa232
(put same data when corresponding data is available in G4NDL4.0 and 
4Be7, 33As74, 69Tm168, 69Tm169 and 74W180 (6 isotopes) are left no data)
Total 417 isotpes data were converted.

Indpendent and cummulative Fission product yield data are newly below
Fission/FF dirctory. They come from ENDF/B-VII.1 neutron fis.yields sublibrary.

This version data cannot work on v9.5.p01 and before


v4.0 (2011.Dec)
Because  the recent major update of the data files, 
we decide to update the major version number of G4NDL. 
G4NDL3.16 renamed G4NDL4.0. You can check past update in README.v3.16

Followings are summary of status of G4NDL4.0
Most data come from ENDF-VII.r0 library and they are processed by NJOY-99.u364 with reconstruction tolerance of 0.001.
Exceptions
Data files for As75, Y90, Pa231, Pa233 and Th232 come from ENDF-VI.r8
       Those ENDF-VII file have trouble either itself or processing by NJOY.
No data files for Be7 and As74
       These files also have the problem and corresponding data file is not available in ENDF-VI.r8
All data file for isotopes heavier than Uranium are excluded from public version
Add simplified level scheme data of Np to Cf (derived from PhotonEvaporation2.0) into inelastic/Gammas 

Thermal Scattring files from ENDF/B-VII are compiled in ThermalScattering.
They are processed by NJOY-99.u364 with reconstruction tolerance of 0.02.
Because of the limitation of current Geant4(v9.5), Several files are not converted. 

Elastic and Inelastic cross section from "JENDL High Energy File 2007" are also compiled in JENDL_HE.
