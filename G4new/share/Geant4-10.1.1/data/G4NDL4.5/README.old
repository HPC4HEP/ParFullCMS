The data in these directories are derived evaluations based on
the following evaluated data libraries (in alphabetic order)

Brond-2.1

ENDF/B-VI.5
FENDL/E2.0
JEF2.2

Large parts of the selections were guided by the FENDL2.0 selection.

This data evaluation is meant exclusively for use with
the neutron_hp and isotope_production categories of geant4.

Use of data in and taken from this directory structure 
for any purpose other than simulation of neutron
scattering and isotope production with the neutron_hp and isotope_production
categories of geant4 is prohibited.

If there is strong interest from your side to use these data
for other purposes, please contact me, and I will try, case by case,
to obtain the agreement of the authors of the evaluated data 
libraries. (Hans-Peter.Wellisch@cern.ch)
