-> converted from $G4LEDATA/rayl files (version 6.23 and anterior)

-> conversion performed using the convertCS.C and convertFF.C ROOT macros

-> for CS files: column units are Geant4 internal units: MeV (1st column) 
    and mm*mm (2nd column)
    Note that CS files were limited up to 10 MeV; 
    E^-2 extraploation is performed above maximum energy of each CS file

-> for FF files: column units are : no unit (1st column is x) 
    and no unit (2nd column is FF)
